# Introduction

This plan provides detailed, actionable steps for tasks 2.1–6.6 of the Certificate Generator Web App, with a focus on frontend refinement, usability, accessibility, and maintainability. Each step is designed for deterministic execution and includes validation criteria.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Implement all features as described in the main implementation plan and specification
- **REQ-002**: Refine frontend for usability, accessibility, and maintainability
- **SEC-001**: Ensure secure handling of user data and assets
- **CON-001**: All steps must be independently verifiable
- **PAT-001**: Use modular, reusable React components
- **PAT-002**: Follow best practices for state management and API integration
- **PAT-003**: Ensure accessibility (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation)


## 2. Implementation Steps (Expanded)

### 2.1 ImportRecipients (CSV/Excel Import)
- Design UI with clear instructions and drag-and-drop/file picker.
- Implement file type/size validation before parsing.
- Use a parsing library (e.g., `papaparse` for CSV, `xlsx` for Excel).
- Show a preview of parsed data before confirming import.
- Allow user to edit/remove imported entries before saving.
- Integrate with global state/context for downstream use.
- Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation for all controls.
- Write unit tests for parsing, error handling, and UI states.

### 2.2 AssetLibrary (Backgrounds/Logos/Signatures)
- UI for asset upload, preview, and management (delete, rename).
- Validate file type/size and sanitize filenames.
- Store assets in local state or backend (with API integration).
- Enable selection of assets for use in Designer.
- Add accessibility: alt text for images, keyboard navigation, ARIA roles.
- Write tests for upload, preview, error handling, and asset selection.

### 2.3 Error Handling & Correction
- Use ErrorFeedback for all user-facing errors.
- Implement a global ErrorBoundary to catch uncaught exceptions.
- Provide actionable error messages and retry options.
- Log errors for monitoring (frontend and backend).
- Test error scenarios (invalid file, network failure, etc.).

### 2.4 Accessibility Audit
- Use tools like axe-core, Lighthouse, or manual keyboard/screen reader testing.
- Document all accessibility issues and remediation steps.
- Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and usable via keyboard.
- Add ARIA attributes and roles where needed.
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver).

### 3.1 SignatureUpload & Placement
- UI for uploading signature image, with preview and error handling.
- Allow drag-and-drop placement and resizing in Designer.
- Store signature position and size in template data.
- Add keyboard controls for moving/resizing signature.
- Test upload, placement, and accessibility.

### 3.2 Designer Image Fields
- Support multiple image fields (background, logo, signature).
- Implement drag, resize, and delete for images.
- Show bounding boxes and handles for resizing.
- Persist image field data in template.
- Write tests for all image field operations.

### 3.3 Instant Preview
- Render a live preview of the certificate as user edits designer.
- Sync designer state with preview component.
- Use canvas or SVG for rendering preview.
- Ensure preview matches final generated certificate.
- Test for performance and accuracy.

### 3.4 ProgressBar for Batch Operations
- Show progress during batch certificate generation/download.
- Update progress in real-time via API or frontend state.
- Add accessible markup (role="progressbar", ARIA attributes).
- Test with large batches for performance and usability.

### 4.1 TemplateManager (Save/Load)
- UI for naming, saving, and loading templates.
- Store templates in local storage or backend.
- Allow user to preview and select templates.
- Validate template data before saving/loading.
- Write tests for template CRUD operations.

### 4.2 DesignGallery (Built-in Designs)
- Display gallery of built-in designs with previews.
- Allow user to select and apply a design to current template.
- Add accessibility: alt text, keyboard navigation, ARIA roles.
- Test gallery display and selection.

### 4.3 Dashboard (Events/Templates)
- List all events and associated templates.
- Allow filtering, searching, and sorting.
- Provide links to edit/view event details and templates.
- Add accessibility for table/grid navigation.
- Write tests for dashboard features.

### 5.1–5.3 Email Integration & Accessibility
- Integrate SendGrid/Mailgun API for sending emails.
- UI for composing, previewing, and sending single/batch emails.
- Show email status (sent, failed, queued).
- Add accessibility for all email workflow steps.
- Test email sending, error handling, and accessibility.

### 6.1 Analytics Dashboard
- UI for viewing delivery/usage stats (charts, tables).
- Fetch analytics data from backend.
- Allow filtering by event, date, template.
- Add accessibility for charts/tables.
- Write tests for analytics features.

### 6.2 Performance Optimization
- Profile frontend for slow operations (large imports, batch generation).
- Use virtualization for large lists/grids.
- Optimize API calls and state updates.
- Test with large datasets.

### 6.3 Export Formats
- Add options for exporting certificates as SVG/DOCX.
- Integrate export logic in backend and frontend.
- UI for selecting export format.
- Test export for correctness and compatibility.

### 6.4 Custom Fields in Designer/Templates
- UI for adding/removing custom fields (text, date, etc.).
- Persist custom field data in template.
- Render custom fields in preview and final certificate.
- Test custom field operations.

### 6.5 Load/Performance Testing
- Use automated tools (Jest, Cypress, Lighthouse) for load testing.
- Simulate large events and batch operations.
- Document and address performance bottlenecks.

### 6.6 User Feedback & Iteration
- Collect feedback via surveys, in-app forms, or analytics.
- Prioritize and implement UI/UX improvements.
- Track changes and validate with follow-up testing.

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Use monolithic frontend (not chosen; modular components preferred)
- **ALT-002**: Use only built-in assets (not chosen; user uploads provide flexibility)

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **DEP-002**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **DEP-003**: AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage
- **DEP-004**: SendGrid/Mailgun (for email)
- **DEP-005**: @testing-library/react, jest, @testing-library/jest-dom

## 5. Files

- **FILE-001**: `/src/components/` (all UI components)
- **FILE-002**: `/src/api/` (API integration)
- **FILE-003**: `/src/context/` (global state)
- **FILE-004**: `/src/tests/` (unit/integration tests)
- **FILE-005**: `/docs/` (documentation)

## 6. Testing

- **TEST-001**: Unit tests for all new/refined components
- **TEST-002**: Integration tests for import, asset, designer, email, analytics workflows
- **TEST-003**: Accessibility tests for all new/refined features
- **TEST-004**: Performance/load tests for large events
- **TEST-005**: End-to-end tests for certificate generation and distribution

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: Third-party service outages (email, storage)
- **RISK-002**: Large batch operations may impact performance
- **RISK-003**: Asset upload/preview may fail on unsupported file types
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: Users have basic web literacy
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: Minimal personal data required
