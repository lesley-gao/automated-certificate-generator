# Introduction

This implementation plan provides a step-by-step, sprint-based roadmap for building the Certificate Generator Web App as defined in the specification file `spec/spec-design-certificate-generator-web-app.md`. The plan is structured for Agile execution, ensuring a functional MVP is delivered first, with incremental features added in subsequent sprints.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Follow all functional and non-functional requirements in the specification file
- **REQ-002**: Deliver a working MVP in Sprint 1
- **REQ-003**: Use the tech stack: React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, AWS S3/Azure Blob
- **SEC-001**: Implement secure storage and minimal personal data handling
- **CON-001**: Accessibility and error handling must be included from Sprint 1
- **CON-002**: All tasks must be executable and independently verifiable
- **PAT-001**: Use wizard-style workflow for user guidance
