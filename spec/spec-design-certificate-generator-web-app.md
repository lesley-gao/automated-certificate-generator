|------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| /api/upload-asset      | POST   | Upload background, logo, or signature       |
| /api/templates         | GET    | List user templates                         |
| /api/templates         | POST   | Create new template                         |
| /api/recipients/import | POST   | Import recipient names (Excel/CSV)          |
| /api/certificates      | POST   | Generate certificates                       |
| /api/certificates      | GET    | Download certificates                       |

### Data Schema Example
```json
{
  "templateId": "string",
  "backgroundUrl": "string",
  "logoUrl": "string",
  "signatureUrl": "string",
  "fields": [
    { "type": "text", "label": "Recipient Name", "position": {"x":0, "y":0} },
    { "type": "text", "label": "Event Name", "position": {"x":0, "y":0} }
  ],
  "recipients": [ "Alice", "Bob" ]
}
```

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-001**: Given a valid template and recipient list, when certificates are generated, then all certificates must be available for download in PNG/PDF format
- **AC-002**: The system shall provide clear error messages and retry options for failed uploads/imports
- **AC-003**: Accessibility features (screen reader, keyboard navigation) must be testable in the UI
- **AC-004**: Users can upload and reuse backgrounds, logos, and signatures
- **AC-005**: Instant preview must reflect all template changes and recipient data

## 6. Test Automation Strategy

- **Test Levels**: Unit, Integration, End-to-End
- **Frameworks**: Jest, React Testing Library (frontend); Mocha/Chai (backend)
- **Test Data Management**: Use mock files and data for uploads/imports
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing in GitHub Actions pipelines
- **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Performance Testing**: Simulate large batch imports and certificate generation

## 7. Rationale & Context

- Wizard-style workflow reduces user errors and confusion
- Minimal personal data lowers privacy risks
- Early accessibility and error handling improve user trust and inclusivity
- Asset reuse saves time for repeat organizers

## 8. Dependencies & External Integrations

### External Systems
- **EXT-001**: Cloud storage (AWS S3 or Azure Blob) for asset and certificate files

### Third-Party Services
- **SVC-001**: Email service (SendGrid, Mailgun) for future email automation

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- **INF-001**: Node.js + Express backend
- **INF-002**: MongoDB database

### Data Dependencies
- **DAT-001**: Excel/CSV files for batch import

### Technology Platform Dependencies
- **PLT-001**: React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui for frontend

### Compliance Dependencies
- **COM-001**: Data privacy best practices (minimal data, secure storage)

## 9. Examples & Edge Cases

``````
// Example: Import file with duplicate names
["Alice", "Bob", "Alice"]
// System highlights duplicates and prompts for resolution

// Example: Upload unsupported file type
// System displays: "File type not supported. Please upload PNG, JPG, or PDF."

// Example: Large batch import (1000+ names)
// System processes and generates certificates with progress indicator
``````

## 10. Validation Criteria

- All acceptance criteria are met
- Accessibility tested with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Error handling tested for all upload/import scenarios

## 12. Agile Sprint Plan

To support Agile methodology and incremental delivery, the project is divided into sprints to ensure a minimum viable product (MVP) is delivered first, with additional features added in subsequent sprints.


### Sprint 1: MVP Foundation (Detailed Plan)

**Goal:** Deliver a functional MVP for certificate generation and download, with a wizard-style workflow and basic accessibility/error handling.


**User Stories (Expanded):**
1. As an event organizer, I want to sign in so my assets and templates are saved securely.
2. As an event organizer, I want to upload a certificate background so I can personalize certificates for my event.
3. As an event organizer, I want to see a preview of my uploaded background so I know it looks correct.
4. As an event organizer, I want to design a certificate by placing and editing text fields (e.g., recipient name, event name) so each certificate is customized.
5. As an event organizer, I want to manually enter, edit, and delete recipient names so I can generate certificates for each participant.
6. As an event organizer, I want to generate certificates in PNG/PDF format so I can distribute them easily.
7. As an event organizer, I want to download all certificates in a batch so I can share them with recipients.
8. As a user, I want clear error messages if uploads or generation fail so I know how to fix issues.
9. As a user, I want to navigate the app using keyboard and screen reader so it is accessible.
10. As a developer, I want to test and document the MVP so it is reliable and easy to use.
